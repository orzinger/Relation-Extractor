After months of both presidential candidates reaching out to moderate and undecided voters, election night, held November 7, 2000, turned out closer than anticipated. Television networks called the close race first for Gore, then for Bush, and finally too close to call. Al Gore, who had conceded the election in a phone call to Bush, rescinded that concession less than one hour later. When the race was finally adjudicated, Bush was declared to have defeated Democratic candidate <a href="/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States" title="Vice President of the United States">Vice President</a> <a href="/wiki/Al_Gore" title="Al Gore" relation="associate_competition">Al Gore</a>, winning 271 <a href="/wiki/U.S._Electoral_College" title="U.S. Electoral College">electoral votes</a> to Gore's 266, carrying 30 of the 50 states. Gore had received a plurality of the national popular vote of the roughly 105,000,000 votes cast, with Bush receiving 50,456,002 votes (47.9%) and Gore 50,999,897 (48.4%) but this fact is not relevant in deciding presidential elections.

When elected President in 2001, Bush asked Rove to give up his direct mail business and join him full-time in Washington.

url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Schleicher
August Schleicher was born in <a href="/wiki/Meiningen" title="Meiningen" relation="birth_place">Meiningen</a> (<a href="/wiki/Duchy" title="Duchy" relation="birth_place">Duchy</a> <a href="/wiki/Saxe-Meiningen" title="Saxe-Meiningen" relation="birth_place">Saxe-Meiningen</a>, southwest of <a href="/wiki/Weimar" title="Weimar" relation="birth_place">Weimar</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Thuringian_Forest" title="Thuringian Forest" relation="birth_place">Thuringian Forest</a>). He began his career studying theology and Indo-European, especially <a href="/wiki/Slavic_languages" title="Slavic languages">Slavic languages</a>. Influenced by <a href="/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" title="Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel" relation="influence">Hegel</a>, he formed the theory that a <a href="/wiki/Language" title="Language">language</a> is an <a href="/wiki/Organism" title="Organism">organism</a>, with periods of development, maturity, and decline. In <a href="/wiki/1850" title="1850">1850</a> Schleicher completed a monograph systematically describing the <a href="/wiki/European_languages" title="European languages">languages of Europe</a>, <i>Die Sprachen Europas in systematischer Übersicht (The languages of Europe in systematic perspective)</i>. He explicitly represented languages as perfectly natural organisms that could most conveniently be described using terms drawn from <a href="/wiki/Biology" title="Biology">biology</a> e.g., <a href="/wiki/Genus" title="Genus">genus</a>, <a href="/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Variety_%28biology%29" title="Variety (biology)">variety</a>. Schleicher claimed that he himself had been convinced of the natural descent and competition of languages before he had read <a href="/wiki/Charles_Darwin" title="Charles Darwin">Darwin’s</a> <i>Origin of Species</i>. He invented a system of language classification that resembled a <a href="/wiki/Botany" title="Botany">botanical</a> taxonomy, tracing groups of <a href="/wiki/Language_families_and_languages" title="Language families and languages">related languages</a> and arranging them in a genealogical tree. His model, the <i>Stammbaumtheorie (family-tree theory)</i>, was a major development in the study of Indo-European languages. To show how Indo-European might have looked he created a short tale, <a href="/wiki/Schleicher%27s_fable" title="Schleicher's fable">Schleicher's fable</a>, to exemplify both words and known culture. He first introduced a graphic representation of a <i><a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_tree" title="Evolutionary tree">Stammbaum</a></i> in articles published in <a href="/wiki/1853" title="1853">1853</a>. By the time of the publication of his <i>Deutsche Sprache (<a href="/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German language</a>)</i> (<a href="/wiki/1860" title="1860">1860</a>) he had begun to use <b>trees to illustrate language descent</b>. Schleicher is commonly recognized as the first linguist to portray <a href="/wiki/Language_development" title="Language development">language development</a> using the figure of a <i>tree</i>. For the most part, however, Darwin’s ideas simply overlaid the fundamental features of Schleicher’s prior <a href="/wiki/Evolutionary_linguistics" title="Evolutionary linguistics">evolutionary project</a>, which derived from the work of those individuals immersed in <a href="/wiki/German_romanticism" title="German romanticism">German romanticism</a> and <a href="/wiki/German_idealism" title="German idealism">idealism</a> especially <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_von_Humboldt" title="Wilhelm von Humboldt" relation="influence">Humboldt</a> and Hegel. August Schleicher died from <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in age of 47 in <a href="/wiki/Jena" title="Jena" relation="death_place">Jena</a> (Duchy <a href="/wiki/Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach" title="Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach" relation="death_place">Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thuringia" title="Thuringia" relation="death_place">Thuringia</a>).

It would be Clampett's skill in making puppets and dolls that ultimately led to his career in animation.

As Clampett would later claim in interviews, Disney was impressed with the young artist, and promised him a job. However, a lack of space at Disney's tiny Hyperion studio prevented Clampett from taking the position. Instead, he secured a job in <a href="/wiki/1931" title="1931">1931</a> at the studio of <a href="/wiki/Hugh_Harman" title="Hugh Harman" relation="associate">Hugh Harman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rudolf_Ising" title="Rudolf Ising" relation="associate">Rudolf Ising</a> where he worked on the studio's <i><a href="/wiki/Looney_Tunes" title="Looney Tunes" relation="opus">Looney Tunes</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Merrie_Melodies" title="Merrie Melodies" relation="opus">Merrie Melodies</a></i> series.

They shared the building with thousands of tiny termites. They christened the building "Termite Terrace", a name eventually used by fans and historians to describe the entire studio.
